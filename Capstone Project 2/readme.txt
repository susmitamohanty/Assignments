Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, defined as sarcopenia, is significantly related to adverse health outcomes e.g. increased risk of falls and fractures, physical frailty, mobility limitation, and even premature mortality.Besides, aging, smoking, physical inactivity, malnutrition and chronic comorbid diseases such as hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), hyperlipidemia and obesity also have deteriorative effects on muscle mass and function. Prevention of sarcopenia-related morbidity and mortality, among aging people in particular, depends on early detection and treatment, more importantly on unraveling the relationships between muscle loss, decline in muscle function and physical performance and the aforementioned potential predictor.

This project is about predicting whether a certain user is going to develop Sarcopenia.
