Customer churn is a major problem that many companies face today. Finance, Telecom or Hospitality - every industry or business is affected,
not only in short term but also long term, in terms of revenues of companies and eventually future growth. It is more expensive to 
add new customers than retaining them.

This project is about predicting whether certain customers are more likely to stop using the service in the future and create a model
that can predict if a certain customer will drop the service.
